# 2 - The Linux System: GNU Utilities

<br>

**GNU Utilities** (GNU's Not Unix) are a complete set of Unix programs developed by the GNU organization under the **Open Source Software (OSS)** philosophy.

When you combined GNU utilities and the Linux kernel, you got the complete operating system.

<br>

## Core Utilities

### The Shell

The **shell** allows users to manage files and processes through its **command prompt**.

The default shell is the **BASH shell** (Bourne Again Shell) by the GNU project, meant to replace the older Bourne shell.

### Desktop Environment

The **X Window System** works with the graphics card and monitor to render window graphics. The system is implemented through different software packages, including the most popular: `X.org`, and others including `Wayland software` (Fedora) and `Mir` (Ubuntu).

The X Window System is low-level, and requires graphical programs over it. Some important ones include:

- **KDE Desktop**
  Older type meant to be similar to Windows
- **GNOME Desktop**
  Popular type used by many distros
- **Unity Desktop**
  Used until recently by Ubuntu
  
and so on.

## Distributions

Distributions are the complete system package, containing the kernel, graphics, utilities, and so on. 

Core Distributions include Fedora and Debian for commercial use, along with more specialized distros such as Ubuntu, Mint, etc.
